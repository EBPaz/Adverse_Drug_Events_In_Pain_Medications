Drug Adverse Events
Eva Pazdera, Aleid van der Zel, Jenny Shin

Research pain medications to determine the number of adverse events over time, between demographics, in relation to generic versus brand name. 
Have these adverse events increased or decreased over long period of time?

1. Adverse events within a specific category of drugs (pain medications OTC vs prescribed) / Changed over time
2. Adverse events of pain medication related to gender, age
3. Adverse events in relation to the generic vs. brand name

Dataset to be used:
Open FDA API
"https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=receivedate:[20040101+TO+20081231]&limit=1"

To do's
Importing Data from API
ID Drugs: Acetaminophen / Ibuprofen vs. Hydrocodone / Oxycodone
Select Criteria from JSON response 
DataFrame created and saved as a CSV
Jupyter Notebook for OTC vs Prescribed number of Adverse of Events / Changed over time?
Jupyter Notebook for Gender and Age
Jupyter Notebook for generic vs. brand name for Acetaminophen vs. RX
Review Data / Final Answer
Put together presentation / create slides

Quarter 1 Acetaminophen

Quarter 1 Ibuprofen
https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=receivedate:[20230101+TO+20230331]+AND+patient.drug.openfda.generic_name:ibuprofen

Quarter 1 Hydrocodone
https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=receivedate:[20230101+TO+20230331]+AND+patient.drug.openfda.generic_name:hydrocodone

Quarter 1 Oxycodone

Variables we can easily identify in the response:
date = results - receivedate
date = results - patient - patientonsetage  *2 options to decide how we want to pick our date - when the report was submitted or when the patient reported it?
country = results - primary source - reportercountry
weight = results - patient - patientweight
sex = results - patient - patientsex
reaction = results - patient - reaction - reactionmdedrapt
medication = results - drug - medicinalproduct
reason for taking the drug = results - drug - drugindication
how they took the drug = results - drug - druggosagetext **not sure this variable one will always be written like this?
